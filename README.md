Exploratory data analysis on the "Data Science Job Salaries" data set on Kaggle

I was trying to explore different careers that I could pursue after my PhD. I’ve considered digital marketing, science communication, UX research, and of course data. The last one really captured my interest and I decided to do some research to back up my gut feel.
I made use of the “[Data Science Job Salaries](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries)” data set on Kaggle and used exploratory data analysis and interactive visualizations on Python to answer the questions I had.
My complete analysis can be viewed on in this repository.
